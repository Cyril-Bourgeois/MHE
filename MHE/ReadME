Model Description
The model contains 9 python files.
- Chapeau.py
   -param_cout.py
  - param_scenario.py
  - lecture_data.py
  - fonctions.py
  - Scenario.py
  - Mesure_Gestion.py
  - Model_MHE.py
  - export.py
 


Chapeeau.py is the master File:  
  - This is the only file to launch in python. 
  - This file contains the definition of the paths for input datas and results
  - This file allows you to manually activate the scenarios and adaptation mesaures you wish to simulate.
  - It calls all the python file which are subpart (the 8 others .py files) of the model and the optimisation solver.

The subpart are briely described in their order of call by chapeau.py
param_scenario.py :
   
param_cout.py :
   - file contains cost using in definition of cost function (stocked in function.py and used in Model_MHE.py)
fonctions.py :
    - files contains the cost function
lecture_data.py : 
   - File for reading data
Scenario.py : 
   - files contains scenario definition
Mesure_gestion.py : 
   - file contains implementation of adaptation measures
Model_MHE.py :
export.py :
   - files who contains codes to export all results
